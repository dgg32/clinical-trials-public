The target population for this study includes patients who meet the 2013 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification for systemic sclerosis, either limited or diffuse cutaneous subsets, with a disease duration of less than 6 years from first non-Raynaud's phenomenon symptom.","detailedDescription":"This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anifrolumab in the treatment of adult participants with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) who may be taking one or a combination of protocol-specified standard therapies. The use of one of the following standard immunosuppressant therapies is permitted at a stable dose, but not mandated: hydroxychloroquine, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mycophenolic acid or mycophenolate sodium (MPA), methotrexate, azathioprine, tacrolimus, and oral glucocorticoids. MMF or MPA, azathioprine, and methotrexate may be used in combination with hydroxychloroquine and/or low-dose oral glucocorticoids \\[≤ 10 mg/day\\].\n\nApproximately 306 eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 120 mg anifrolumab (or matching placebo) given subcutaneously once weekly for 52 weeks. The study will be stratified by the following factors:\n\n* Interstitial lung disease (ILD) (yes, no) at Week 0 (Day1);\n* MMF or MPA use (yes ,no) at Week 0 (Day 1); and\n* Disease duration, defined as the time from the first non-Raynaud's symptom attributable to SSc (\\<18 months, ≥ 18 months) at Week 0 (Day 1)\n\nStudy treatment will be administered subcutaneously via an accessorized prefilled syringe by study staff or by the participant or carer, either in the clinic or at home, with most doses being administered at home. The study consists of 4 periods: a 6-week screening period, a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, a 52-week open-label active treatment period, and a 12-week safety follow-up period. There are a total of 16 study visits with most visits in the treatment period occurring every 8 to 12 weeks. The periods are described below:\n\n* Screening Period: This may involve one or more visits to the study site.\n* Double Blind Treatment Period: Treatment Period when participants will receive once weekly injections of anifrolumab or matching placebo. Participation will involve in-clinic study visits at Weeks 0 (Day 1), 1, 4, 8\\*, 16, 24, 36, 48 and 52. \\*The visit at Week 8 may be either by telephone or in person.\n* Open Label Treatment Period: At Week 52, all participants will be given anifrolumab 120 mg (subcutaneous) once weekly for 52 weeks (last dose at Week 103). Participation will involve in-clinic study visits at Weeks 52, 56, 64, 76. 88 and 104.\n* Safety Follow-up Period: All participants will return to the clinic for a 12-week post treatment visit. This will occur post Double Blind Treatment Period (Week 52 or Double Blind Period early discontinuation) or post Open Label Treatment Period (Week 104 or Open Label Period early discontinuation)."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Systemic Sclerosis","Scleroderma"],"keywords":["Systemic Sclerosis (SSc)","Scleroderma","Anifrolumab","Limited","Diffuse","Cutaneous","Interstitial lung disease (ILD)","Autoimmune diseases","Immune system diseases","Immunosuppressants","Systemic Sclerosis interstitial lung disease (SSc- ILD)"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","interventionModelDescription":"Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either anifrolumab or matching placebo for 52 weeks (double blind treatment period).

Sometimes doctors need to inject contrast agent into a patient's vein to perform a \"contrast-enhanced\" MRI (CE-MRI). Such CE-MRI may help identify certain health problems or improve the evaluation.\n\nThe contrast agents commonly used in MRI are gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). GBCAs contain a \"rare earth\" element called gadolinium (Gd). Gadoquatrane is a new contrast agent under development with a lower amount of Gd needed per CE-MRI.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn whether CE-MRI scans with gadoquatrane work better than MRI scans without the use of a contrast agent (GBCA). The researchers will compare the ability to detect known or suspected problems (except brain or spinal cord-related problems) with gadoquatrane-MRI scans to plain-MRI scans without the use of a contrast agent.\n\nThe participants will undergo 2 MRI scans, one with gadoquatrane and one with currently used GBCA. Both contrast agents will be injected into the vein.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for between 6 and 42 days with up to 7 doctor visits.\n\nAt the start or during the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* take blood and urine samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check blood pressure and heart rate\n* review the MRI scans obtained in the study and decide on the diagnosis\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Contrast Enhancement in Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Non-central Nervous System Pathology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"The site staff in charge of the preparation and administration of study intervention will be unblinded and will not be involved in any evaluation of safety and efficacy.

Sometimes doctors need to inject a contrast agent into a patient's vein to perform a \"contrast-enhanced\" MRI (CE-MRI). Such CE-MRI may help identify certain health problems or improve the evaluation.\n\nThe contrast agents commonly used in MRI are gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). GBCAs contain a \"rare earth\" element called gadolinium (Gd). Gadoquatrane is a new contrast agent under development with a lower amount of Gd needed per CE-MRI.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn whether CE-MRI scans with gadoquatrane work better than MRI scans without the use of a contrast agent (GBCA). The researchers will compare the ability to detect brain and spinal cord-related problems in gadoquatrane-MRI scans to plain-MRI scans without the use of a contrast agent.\n\nThe participants will undergo 2 MRI scans, one with gadoquatrane and one with currently used GBCA. Both contrast agents will be injected into the vein.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for between 6 and 42 days with up to 7 doctor visits.\n\nAt the start or during the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* take blood and urine samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check blood pressure and heart rate\n* review the MRI scans obtained in the study and decide on the diagnosis\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Contrast Enhancement in Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Central Nervous System Pathology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The site staff in charge of the preparation and administration of study intervention will be unblinded and will not be involved in any evaluation of safety and efficacy.

Sometimes doctors need to inject a contrast agent into a patient's vein to perform a \"contrast-enhanced\" MRI (CE-MRI). CE-MRI may allow doctors to identify certain health problems or improve their evaluation.\n\nThe contrast agents commonly used in MRI are gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). GBCAs contain a \"rare earth\" element called gadolinium (Gd), which is needed for the increase in signal intensity and contrast in MRI. The gadolinium in these contrast agents is caged in a molecule (chelate complex). Researchers are developing new contrast agents with a lower amount of Gd needed per CE-MRI investigation. Gadoquatrane is one of these new contrast agents. It has been tested in several studies previously.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how gadoquatrane moves into, through, and out of the body and how safe it is in children. The researchers will measure the amount of gadoquatrane in the blood at different time points after a single injection.\n\nThe participants will undergo an MRI scan and receive gadoquatrane once at a dose of 0.04 mmol Gd/kg (corresponding to 0.1 mL/kg). It is injected into the participant's vein (also called an intravenous injection) during the MRI scan.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for between 8 and 38 days with up to 5 doctor visits, including the screening phase of up to 28 days with no more than 2 visits. Once a participant has received the injection of gadoquatrane, the remaining study duration is 7 (±1) days.\n\nAt the start or during the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* check the weight and height of the participant,\n* ask for information like age and medical history,\n* take participants' blood samples,\n* ask participants questions about medicines they are taking,\n* check blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature,\n* check the area where the participants had the intravenous injection,\n* do pregnancy tests in girls of childbearing age,\n* review the MRI scans obtained in the study and decide on the diagnosis\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Contrast Enhancement in Magnetic Resonance

As a routine clinical practice, presence of respiratory symptoms using standard electronic medical record (EMR) format are universally assessed at the emergency room when the patients are determined to be admitted. Patients are registered if they meet the eligibility criteria and information of medical history, baseline characteristics, living status, physical findings, laboratory tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, on admission are retrieved from the EMRs. The nasopharyngeal swab is obtained within 24 hours after admission as a standard practice, which will be sampled at either emergency rooms or hospital wards. The swab is transferred to the onsite laboratory office to measure the FilmArray 2.1 by trained technicians or physicians in charge.\n\nSerum antibodies for RS virus are obtained from patients with suspected lower respiratory infection (bronchitis and pneumonia) who provided their written informed consent, at the timing of admission and 4 weeks after the admission."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)","Respiratory Viral Infection","Acute Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"RS virus infection","description":"Presence of RS virus infection measured by FilmArray 2.1","timeFrame":"On admission"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Respiratory virus and other microorganisms","description":"Presence of respiratory virus and other microorganisms measured by FilmArray 2.1","timeFrame":"On admission"},{"measure":"RS virus infection measured by paired serologic tests","description":"Presence of RS virus infection measured by paired serologic tests (neutralizing antibody method)","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Lower respiratory tract infections","description":"Presence of at least 2 lower respiratory symptoms/signs for at least 24 hours including at least 1 lower respiratory sign or presence of at least 3 lower respiratory symptoms for at least 24 hours according to the Table S2 from the following reference.\n\nPapi A, Ison MG, Langley JM, Lee DG, Leroux-Roels I, Martinon-Torres F, Schwarz TF, van Zyl-Smit RN, Campora L, Dezutter N, de Schrevel N, Fissette L, David MP, Van der Wielen M, Kostanyan L, Hulstrøm V; AReSVi-006 Study Group.

However, the possible mechanistic insights into clinical benefits of finerenone in that patient population are currently very limited.

BI 764532 and ezabenlimab are antibodies that may help the immune system fight cancer. Participants get BI 764532 and ezabenlimab as infusions into a vein.\n\nIf there is benefit for the participants and if they can tolerate it, the treatment is given for a maximum of 3 years. During this time, participants visit the study site about every week. The visits also depend on the response to the treatment.

Mim8 is a new medicine that is used to prevent bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A. Mim8 works by replacing the function of the missing clotting factor VIII (FVIII). Mim8 will be injected under the skin using a pen-injector either once every week, once every two weeks or once every month. The participants will be trained in using the pen injector. The participants can choose themselves, in collaboration with the study doctor how often they get Mim8 in this study. When the participant will get their first Mim8 injection depends on their current treatment with emicizumab. The participants will get their first Mim8 injection at Visit 2. Participants will have between 6 and 27 Mim8 injections. The total number of injections participants will have depends on their dosing frequency. The study will last for about 6-12 months. While taking part in this study, there are some restrictions about what medicine participant can use. The study doctor will tell the participants more about this. In case the participants experience bleeds, these can be treated with additional haemostatic medicine as agreed with the study doctor. Female participants cannot take part if they are pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to get pregnant during the study period."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Haemophilia A","Haemophilia A With Inhibitors"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":48,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"NNC0365-3769 (Mim8) PPX","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive Mim8 prophylaxis (PPX) subcutaneous (s.c.) injection using a prefilled fixed dose DV3407-C1 pen-injector.","interventionNames":["Drug: NNC0365-3769 (Mim8) PPX"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"NNC0365-3769 (Mim8) PPX","description":"Participants will receive Mim8 PPX once-weekly dosing (QW), once every two weeks dosing (Q2W), or once-monthly dosing s.c. injection using a prefilled fixed dose DV3407-C1 pen-injector for 26 weeks.","armGroupLabels":["NNC0365-3769 (Mim8) PPX"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Number of treatment-emergent adverse events","description":"Measured as count of events.","timeFrame":"From Visit 2 (week 0) until week 26"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Device handling experience using the Hemophilia Device Handling and Preference Assessment (HDHPA) questionnaire","description":"Measured as percentage of participants.

A migraine attack is a headache that may be accompanied by throbbing, nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light and sound, or other symptoms. This study will assess how safe and effective three different doses of atogepant is compared to placebo in adult Japanese participants. Change in migraine symptoms will be assessed.\n\nAtogepant (Qulipta) is an approved drug to treat adults with episodic migraine in the United States. Participants are randomly assigned to one of the 4 treatment groups called Arms to receive atogepant or matching placebo. There is 1 in a 4 chance for the participant to receive placebo. This is double-blinded study which means neither study doctor not the participant will know if the participant received atogepant or placebo. Approximately 520 adult participants with episodic migraine will be enrolled in approximately 45 sites across Japan.\n\nParticipants will receive oral atogepant or matching placebo tablets once daily for 12 weeks. At 12 weeks participants assigned to atogepant dose A, dose B or dose C will continue to receive same treatment for 12 additional weeks and participants assigned to placebo will be re-randomized to receive atogepant dose A, dose B or dose C for 12 additional weeks. All participants will be followed for 30 days following last dose of study drug.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The safety and tolerability of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for adverse events and completing questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Migraine"],"keywords":["Migraine","Episodic Migraine","Atogepant"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":520,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Atogepant Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive atogepant dose A once daily (QD) for 24 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Atogepant"]},{"label":"Atogepant Dose B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive atogepant dose B QD for 24 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Atogepant"]},{"label":"Atogepant Dose C","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive atogepant dose C QD for 24 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Atogepant"]},{"label":"Placebo","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive placebo QD for 12 weeks.

The retina is the very back part of the eye. The blocked vein causes fluid and blood to leak into the retina and thereby causes a swelling of the macula (the center of the retina responsible for fine vision). This swelling is called macular edema.\n\nWhen a vein in the retina is blocked, the levels of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) rises. VEGF helps the growth of new blood vessels. This can lead to macular edema and may cause the vision to become blurry.\n\nThe study treatment intravitreal (IVT) aflibercept is given as an injection into the eye. It works by blocking VEGF and this can help repair vision problems related to RVO. IVT aflibercept is already available and is prescribed by doctors as the standard of care treatment for macula edema secondary to RVO. Standard of care is a treatment that medical experts consider most appropriate for a disease.\n\nStandard of care is given every 4 weeks in people with macula edema secondary to RVO. While repeated injections of aflibercept may prevent worsening of vision, it may place a burden on the patient. However, a higher amount (8 mg) compared to the standard of care (2 mg) of IVT aflibercept is being tested in studies. This higher amount could be given less often. The amount of IVT aflibercept given is measured in milligrams, also known as mg.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how well a higher amount of the study treatment aflibercept works in people with macular edema secondary to RVO. To answer this, researchers will measure changes in vision called best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study participants between study start and after 36 weeks of treatment. Changes will then be compared between those participants who received the higher amount of IVT aflibercept and those that received standard of care.\n\nTo learn how safe the study treatment is in the participants, the researchers will count the number of participants from study start and up to 64 weeks later that have:\n\n* adverse events\n* serious adverse events\n\n\"Adverse events\" are any medical problems that the participants have during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen in studies, even if they do not think they might be related to the study treatments. An adverse event is considered \"serious\" when it leads to death, puts the participants' lives at risk, requires hospitalization, causes disability, causes a baby being born with medical problems or is otherwise medically important.\n\nDependent on the treatment group, the participants will either receive the higher amount of aflibercept or standard of care as an intravitreal injection for up to 60 weeks. The study will consist of a test (screening) phase, a treatment phase and an end of study phase. Each participant will be in the study for up to 64 weeks.\n\nOne visit to the study site is planned during the screening phase, followed by visits approximately every 4 weeks (16 in total) during treatment and one visit at the end of the study.\n\nDuring the study, the study doctors and their team will:\n\n* check patients' eye health using various eye examination techniques\n* measure patients' eye vision (BCVA)\n* take blood and urine samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check vital signs\n* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* do pregnancy tests in women of childbearing age\n\nIn addition, participants will be asked to fill a questionnaire on vision-related quality of life."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Macular Edema Secondary to Retinal Vein Occlusion"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":822,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Higher Dose Regimen 1","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Higher dose of aflibercept is administered with initial initiation doses intervals, followed by extension of treatment intervals and further adjustment of intervals according to treatment response.","interventionNames":["Drug: Aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye(Eylea, BAY86-5321)_higher dose","Drug: Sham","Diagnostic Test: Fluorescein"]},{"label":"Higher Dose Regimen 2","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Higher dose of aflibercept is administered with initial initiation doses intervals, followed by extension of treatment intervals and further adjustment of intervals according to treatment response.","interventionNames":["Drug: Aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye(Eylea, BAY86-5321)_higher dose","Drug: Sham","Diagnostic Test: Fluorescein"]},{"label":"Standard of care","type":"ACTIVE_COMPARATOR","description":"Aflibercept 2 mg is administered by standard treatment intervals, followed by adjustment of treatment intervals according to treatment response.","interventionNames":["Drug: Aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye(Eylea, BAY86-5321)_2 mg","Diagnostic Test: Fluorescein"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye(Eylea, BAY86-5321)_higher dose","interventionMappedName":[],"description":"Intravitreally (IVT) injection.","armGroupLabels":["Higher Dose Regimen 1","Higher Dose Regimen 2"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Aflibercept, VEGF Trap-Eye(Eylea, BAY86-5321)_2 mg","interventionMappedName":[],"description":"Intravitreally (IVT) injection.","armGroupLabels":["Standard of care"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Sham","description":"Sham procedure will be given on visits when an active injection is not planned.","armGroupLabels":["Higher Dose Regimen 1","Higher Dose Regimen 2"]},{"type":"DIAGNOSTIC_TEST","name":"Fluorescein","interventionMappedName":[],"description":"Fluorescein 100 mg/mL solution for injection is a dye that makes the retinal vessels visible during FA examinations, and as such, it will be used as an auxiliary medicinal product (AxMP) in this periodic ophthalmic examination.

This study will assess how safe and effective upadacitinib is in treating adult participants with moderately to severely active SLE. Adverse events and change in the disease activity will be assessed.\n\nUpadacitinib is an approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and axial spondylarthritis and is being developed for the treatment of SLE. This study is \"double-blinded\", which means that neither the trial participants nor the study doctors will know who will be given upadacitinib and who will be given placebo (does not contain treatment drug) . This study comprised of 3 sub studies. In Study 1 and Study 2, study doctors put the participants in 1 of the 2 groups, called treatment arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 in 2 chance that participants will be assigned to placebo. Eligible participants from Study 1 and Study 2 will enter Study 3 at week 52 to receive specific doses of upadacitinib based on their disease activity and their original treatment assignment in Study 1 or 2. Approximately 500 participants diagnosed with SLE will be enrolled in each of the Study 1 and Study 2 in approximately 320 sites across the world.\n\nParticipants will receive oral tablets of upadacitinib or matching placebo once daily for 52 weeks in Study 1 and Study 2. Eligible participants from Study 1 and Study 2 will receive oral tablets of upadacitinib once daily for 52 weeks in Study 3.\n\nThere may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, checking for side effects and completing questionnaires."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Systemic Lupus Erythematosus"],"keywords":["Systemic Lupus Erythematosus","SLE","Upadacitinib","Lupus"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":1000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Study 1- Upadacitinib Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive upadacitinib dose A once daily for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Upadacitinib"]},{"label":"Study 1- Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive upadacitinib matching placebo once daily for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Study 2- Upadacitinib Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants will receive upadacitinib dose A once daily for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Upadacitinib"]},{"label":"Study 2- Placebo","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","description":"Participants will receive upadacitinib matching placebo once daily for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo"]},{"label":"Study 3- Low Disease Activity Upadacitinib (LDA) Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the upadacitinib arms from Study 1 or Study 2 with LDA will receive upadacitinib dose A once daily for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Upadacitinib"]},{"label":"Study 3- Low Disease Activity Upadacitinib Dose B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the upadacitinib arms from Study 1 or Study 2 with LDA will receive upadacitinib dose B once daily for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Upadacitinib"]},{"label":"Study 3- No LDA Upadacitinib Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the upadacitinib arms from Study 1 or Study 2 with no LDA will receive upadacitinib dose A once daily for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Upadacitinib"]},{"label":"Study 3- Upadacitininb Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants in the placebo arms of Study 1 or Study 2 will receive upadacitinib Dose A once daily for 52 weeks.","interventionNames":["Drug: Upadacitinib"]},{"label":"Study 3- Open Label Upadacitinib Dose A","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants who experience a suspected systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) flare may receive open label upadacitinib Dose A once daily for the remainder of the study.","interventionNames":["Drug: Upadacitinib"]},{"label":"Study 3- Open Label Upadacitinib Dose B","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Participants who reach \\>= 65 years of age and are still on study drug may receive open-label upadacitinib Dose B once daily, and participants who experience a suspected SLE flare while on upadacitinib Dose B may receive upadacitinib Dose A for the remainder of the study.","interventionNames":["Drug: Upadacitinib"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Upadacitinib","interventionMappedName":[],"description":"Oral Tablets","armGroupLabels":["Study 1- Upadacitinib Dose A","Study 2- Upadacitinib Dose A","Study 3- Low Disease Activity Upadacitinib (LDA) Dose A","Study 3- Low Disease Activity Upadacitinib Dose B","Study 3- No LDA Upadacitinib Dose A","Study 3- Open Label Upadacitinib Dose A","Study 3- Open Label Upadacitinib Dose B","Study 3- Upadacitininb Dose A"],"otherNames":["RINVOQ"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo","description":"Oral Tablet","armGroupLabels":["Study 1- Placebo","Study 2- Placebo"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Participants Achieving British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Based Combined Lupus Assessment (BICLA) Response","description":"BICLA is a composite responder index based on improvement in organ systems without worsening of the overall condition and improvement in disease activity.","timeFrame":"At Week 52"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Percentage of Flares Participants Experiencing Over Time (Number of Flares Per Patient-Year)","description":"Flare is defined by the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) Systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) Flare Index (SFI).

By acting on WRN, HRO761 may be able to stop the growth of the cancer.\n\nThis is the first time HRO761 is given to patients and the first time HRO761 is used in combination with tislelizumab or irinotecan.\n\nTislelizumab has been used in other cancer studies in the past few years and irinotecan is a drug approved in several countries and is used as standard treatment for certain types of cancer (e.g., colon cancer and small cell lung cancer).\n\nThis research study will consist of various treatment arms to investigate HRO761 as single agent and in the combinations.\n\nFor HRO761 single agent, the research will be done in two parts the first part is called \"dose escalation\" and the second part is called \"dose optimization\" In the dose escalation part, different groups of people will be given different doses of HRO761 to understand how the body reacts to different doses of the drug and how well the drug acts against the cancer. During the dose optimization part, the selected doses will be tested in more patients until a recommended dose(s) is found.\n\nThe combinations of HRO761with tislelizumab or irinotecan will also first be tested in a dose escalation part to find the recommended doses of HRO761 in these combinations.\n\nOnce the recommended doses are determined, more people may be treated with HRO761 alone or together with tislelizumab or irinotecan to further assess the study treatment effects against various types of MSIhi or dMMR cancers. This part is called dose expansion.\n\nFor this research, a number of blood and tissue samples will be collected during the study. Patients may be asked to come approximately 8 times to the clinic during the first 8 weeks and approximately every 2 or 4 weeks thereafter.\n\nPatients will be in the study as long as their study doctor believes that they may be benefiting from the study treatment, unless the patient decides to stop study treatment."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["MSIhi or dMMR Advanced Unresectable or Metastatic Solid Tumors, Including Colorectal Cancers"],"keywords":["Phase I/Ib","MSIhi (Microsatellite Instability-High)","dMMR (Mismatch Repair Deficient)","solid tumors","CRC (Colorectal cancer)","advanced cancer","metastatic","HRO761","tislelizumab","irinotecan"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE1"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NON_RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"SEQUENTIAL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE","maskingDescription":"This is an open label study.

The purpose of this study is to find out whether a medicine called spesolimab helps people with HS. People who have previously taken specific medicines such as immunosuppressive biologics other than Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors cannot take part.\n\nThis study has 2 parts. In Part 1, participants are divided into 4 groups of almost equal size. 3 groups get different doses of spesolimab, 1 group gets placebo. All participants get injections into a vein or under the skin. Placebo injections look like spesolimab injections, but do not contain any medicine. Every participant has an equal chance of being in each group. In the beginning, participants get the study medicine every week and later every 2 weeks. After 4 months, participants in the placebo group switch to spesolimab treatment.\n\nIn Part 2, participants are divided into 2 groups. One group gets a suitable dose of spesolimab that was found in Part 1 of the study. The other group gets placebo. After 4 months, participants in the placebo group switch to spesolimab treatment.\n\nParticipants join only one of the two parts. They are in the study for about 1 year. During this time, they visit the study site in the beginning every week and later every 2 weeks. Some of the visits can be done at the participant's home instead of the study site. The doctors regularly check participants' HS symptoms. The results are compared between the groups to see whether spesolimab works. The doctors also regularly check participants' general health and take note of any unwanted effects.","detailedDescription":"Main endpoints for Part 2 will be supported by Part1 results available at time of primary analysis."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Hidradenitis Suppurativa"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE2","PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"TREATMENT","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","whoMasked":["PARTICIPANT","CARE_PROVIDER","INVESTIGATOR","OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":200,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Part I: Low dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Spesolimab Formulation 1","Drug: Spesolimab Formulation 2"]},{"label":"Part I: Medium dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Spesolimab Formulation 1","Drug: Spesolimab Formulation 2"]},{"label":"Part I: High dose group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Spesolimab Formulation 1","Drug: Spesolimab Formulation 2"]},{"label":"Part I: Placebo group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo matching Spesolimab Formulation 1","Drug: Placebo matching Spesolimab Formulation 2"]},{"label":"Part II: Active (treatment) group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","interventionNames":["Drug: Spesolimab Formulation 2"]},{"label":"Part II: Placebo group","type":"PLACEBO_COMPARATOR","interventionNames":["Drug: Placebo matching Spesolimab Formulation 2"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"DRUG","name":"Spesolimab Formulation 1","description":"Spesolimab Formulation 1","armGroupLabels":["Part I: High dose group","Part I: Low dose group","Part I: Medium dose group"],"otherNames":["Spevigo®"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Spesolimab Formulation 2","description":"Spesolimab Formulation 2","armGroupLabels":["Part I: High dose group","Part I: Low dose group","Part I: Medium dose group","Part II: Active (treatment) group"],"otherNames":["Spevigo®"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo matching Spesolimab Formulation 1","description":"Placebo matching Spesolimab Formulation 1","armGroupLabels":["Part I: Placebo group"]},{"type":"DRUG","name":"Placebo matching Spesolimab Formulation 2","description":"Placebo matching Spesolimab Formulation 2","armGroupLabels":["Part I: Placebo group","Part II: Placebo group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Part 1: Percent change from baseline in Draining fistula/tunnel (dT) count at Week 8","timeFrame":"At baseline and at week 8"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Part 1: Percent change from baseline in dT count at Week 16 (part 1)","timeFrame":"At baseline and at week 16"},{"measure":"Part 1: Absolute change from baseline in International hidradenitis suppurativa severity score system (IHS4) value at Week 8","description":"The IHS4 score is arrived at by the number of nodules (multiplied by 1) plus the number of abscesses (multiplied by 2) plus the number of draining tunnels (multiplied by 4).\n\nA total score of 3 or less signifies mild, 4-10 signifies moderate and 11 or higher signifies severe disease.","timeFrame":"At baseline and at week 8"},{"measure":"Part 1: Absolute change from baseline in IHS4 value at Week 16","timeFrame":"At baseline and at week 16"},{"measure":"Part 1: Occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)","timeFrame":"up to 64 weeks"}]},"eligibilityModule":{"eligibilityCriteria":"Inclusion Criteria:\n\n1.
