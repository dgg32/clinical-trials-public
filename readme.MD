# Introduction
  

This repository contains code and data for my article "[Clinical Trials as Graphs andÂ Vectors](https://dgg32.medium.com/learn-japanese-onomatopoeia-with-neo4j-a7306c7933ec)". 

1. The script json_exploration are for data download and formatting.

2. The data folder for_neo4j contains the TSV ready for Neo4j import.

3. The neo4j_test.hwf is an Apache Hop workflow file. It will connects to your Neo4j, copy the formatted TSV files to the Import folder and import them. For details, please refer to my article.
