Sometimes doctors need to inject contrast agent into a patient's vein to perform a \"contrast-enhanced\" MRI (CE-MRI). Such CE-MRI may help identify certain health problems or improve the evaluation.\n\nThe contrast agents commonly used in MRI are gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). GBCAs contain a \"rare earth\" element called gadolinium (Gd). Gadoquatrane is a new contrast agent under development with a lower amount of Gd needed per CE-MRI.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn whether CE-MRI scans with gadoquatrane work better than MRI scans without the use of a contrast agent (GBCA). The researchers will compare the ability to detect known or suspected problems (except brain or spinal cord-related problems) with gadoquatrane-MRI scans to plain-MRI scans without the use of a contrast agent.\n\nThe participants will undergo 2 MRI scans, one with gadoquatrane and one with currently used GBCA. Both contrast agents will be injected into the vein.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for between 6 and 42 days with up to 7 doctor visits.\n\nAt the start or during the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* take blood and urine samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check blood pressure and heart rate\n* review the MRI scans obtained in the study and decide on the diagnosis\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Contrast Enhancement in Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Non-central Nervous System Pathology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","interventionModelDescription":"The site staff in charge of the preparation and administration of study intervention will be unblinded and will not be involved in any evaluation of safety and efficacy.

Sometimes doctors need to inject a contrast agent into a patient's vein to perform a \"contrast-enhanced\" MRI (CE-MRI). Such CE-MRI may help identify certain health problems or improve the evaluation.\n\nThe contrast agents commonly used in MRI are gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). GBCAs contain a \"rare earth\" element called gadolinium (Gd). Gadoquatrane is a new contrast agent under development with a lower amount of Gd needed per CE-MRI.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn whether CE-MRI scans with gadoquatrane work better than MRI scans without the use of a contrast agent (GBCA). The researchers will compare the ability to detect brain and spinal cord-related problems in gadoquatrane-MRI scans to plain-MRI scans without the use of a contrast agent.\n\nThe participants will undergo 2 MRI scans, one with gadoquatrane and one with currently used GBCA. Both contrast agents will be injected into the vein.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for between 6 and 42 days with up to 7 doctor visits.\n\nAt the start or during the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* take blood and urine samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check blood pressure and heart rate\n* review the MRI scans obtained in the study and decide on the diagnosis\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Contrast Enhancement in Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Central Nervous System Pathology"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["PHASE3"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"CROSSOVER","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"QUADRUPLE","maskingDescription":"The site staff in charge of the preparation and administration of study intervention will be unblinded and will not be involved in any evaluation of safety and efficacy.

Sometimes doctors need to inject a contrast agent into a patient's vein to perform a \"contrast-enhanced\" MRI (CE-MRI). CE-MRI may allow doctors to identify certain health problems or improve their evaluation.\n\nThe contrast agents commonly used in MRI are gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). GBCAs contain a \"rare earth\" element called gadolinium (Gd), which is needed for the increase in signal intensity and contrast in MRI. The gadolinium in these contrast agents is caged in a molecule (chelate complex). Researchers are developing new contrast agents with a lower amount of Gd needed per CE-MRI investigation. Gadoquatrane is one of these new contrast agents. It has been tested in several studies previously.\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to learn how gadoquatrane moves into, through, and out of the body and how safe it is in children. The researchers will measure the amount of gadoquatrane in the blood at different time points after a single injection.\n\nThe participants will undergo an MRI scan and receive gadoquatrane once at a dose of 0.04 mmol Gd/kg (corresponding to 0.1 mL/kg). It is injected into the participant's vein (also called an intravenous injection) during the MRI scan.\n\nEach participant will be in the study for between 8 and 38 days with up to 5 doctor visits, including the screening phase of up to 28 days with no more than 2 visits. Once a participant has received the injection of gadoquatrane, the remaining study duration is 7 (±1) days.\n\nAt the start or during the study, the doctors and their study team will:\n\n* check the weight and height of the participant,\n* ask for information like age and medical history,\n* take participants' blood samples,\n* ask participants questions about medicines they are taking,\n* check blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature,\n* check the area where the participants had the intravenous injection,\n* do pregnancy tests in girls of childbearing age,\n* review the MRI scans obtained in the study and decide on the diagnosis\n* ask the participants questions about how they are feeling and what adverse events they are having.\n\nAn adverse event is any medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events, irrespective if they think it is related or not to the study treatments."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Contrast Enhancement in Magnetic Resonance

As a routine clinical practice, presence of respiratory symptoms using standard electronic medical record (EMR) format are universally assessed at the emergency room when the patients are determined to be admitted. Patients are registered if they meet the eligibility criteria and information of medical history, baseline characteristics, living status, physical findings, laboratory tests, chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, on admission are retrieved from the EMRs. The nasopharyngeal swab is obtained within 24 hours after admission as a standard practice, which will be sampled at either emergency rooms or hospital wards. The swab is transferred to the onsite laboratory office to measure the FilmArray 2.1 by trained technicians or physicians in charge.\n\nSerum antibodies for RS virus are obtained from patients with suspected lower respiratory infection (bronchitis and pneumonia) who provided their written informed consent, at the timing of admission and 4 weeks after the admission."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)","Respiratory Viral Infection","Acute Disease"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"OBSERVATIONAL","patientRegistry":true,"targetDuration":"6 Months","designInfo":{"observationalModel":"COHORT","timePerspective":"PROSPECTIVE"},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"RS virus infection","description":"Presence of RS virus infection measured by FilmArray 2.1","timeFrame":"On admission"}],"secondaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Respiratory virus and other microorganisms","description":"Presence of respiratory virus and other microorganisms measured by FilmArray 2.1","timeFrame":"On admission"},{"measure":"RS virus infection measured by paired serologic tests","description":"Presence of RS virus infection measured by paired serologic tests (neutralizing antibody method)","timeFrame":"4 weeks"},{"measure":"Lower respiratory tract infections","description":"Presence of at least 2 lower respiratory symptoms/signs for at least 24 hours including at least 1 lower respiratory sign or presence of at least 3 lower respiratory symptoms for at least 24 hours according to the Table S2 from the following reference.\n\nPapi A, Ison MG, Langley JM, Lee DG, Leroux-Roels I, Martinon-Torres F, Schwarz TF, van Zyl-Smit RN, Campora L, Dezutter N, de Schrevel N, Fissette L, David MP, Van der Wielen M, Kostanyan L, Hulstrøm V; AReSVi-006 Study Group.
